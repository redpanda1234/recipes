Recipe: Best french onion soup (that's what they all say...)

- Summary
  - Serves 6
  - Use a Dutch oven with at least a 7-quart capacity
    for this recipe.
  - Sweet onions, such as Vidalia or Walla Walla, will
    make this recipe overly sweet.
  - Note that the entire process for caramelizing the
    onions takes 45 to 60 minutes.
  - Use broiler-safe crocks and keep the rim of the bowls
    4 to 5 inches from the heating element to obtain a
    proper gratine of melted, bubbly cheese.
  - If using ordinary soup bowls, sprinkle the toasted
    bread slices with Gruyere and return them to the
    boiler until the cheese melts, then float them on top
    of the soup.
