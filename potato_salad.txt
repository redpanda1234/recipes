Recipe: Austrian-style potato salad

- Summary
  - Serves 4 to 6
  - The finished salad should be creamy and loose, with
    chunks of potato that keep their shape but are very
    tender.
  - If you can't find cornichons, chopped kosher dill
    pickles can be substituted.
  - For best results, don't refrigerate the salad; it
    should be served within 4 hours of preparation.
