Recipe: Creamless creamy tomato soup

- Summary 6 to 8
  - Make sure to purchase canned whole tomatoes
    in juice, not puree.
  - If half of the soup fills your blender by
    more than two thirds, process the soup in
    three batches.
  - You can also use an immersion blender to process
    the soup directly in the pot.
  - For an even smoother soup, pass the pureed mixture
    through a fine-mesh strainer before stirring in the
    chicken broth
