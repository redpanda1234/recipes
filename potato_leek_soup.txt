Recipe: Creamy leek-potato soup

- Summary
  - Serves 4 to 6
  - Dont' fill the blender by more than two-thirds
    with hot soup; if necessary, process in three
    batches.
  - You can also use an immersion blender to process
    the soup directly in the pot
  - Use the lowest setting on your toaster to dry
    out the bread without overbrowning it.
  - A garnish is essential to add texture and flavor
    to this soup.
  - In addition to fried leeks, we also like to serve
    this soup with crisp bacon bits, a dollop of sour
    cream, freshly chopped chives, and Garlic Chips
    or Garlic Croutons.
